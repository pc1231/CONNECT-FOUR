- Each player gets a turn to place their circles into the table.
- You can only put one at a time.
- The first player to connect four circles either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Motivation
Motivation:
	My passion for the game is actually what inspired me to create it. My home is inhabited by a sizable family. With our parents, there were perhaps eight of us kids. Our ages were all between 18 and 4. There was only one game that permitted players of such a wide age range to interact with one another. It was a Connect Four game. There was a lot of excitement between us, whether it was beating my little sibling or my older brother. Everyone was able to take part, which made for enjoyable family time spent by all age groups.
